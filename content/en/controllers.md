## GameCube Controller

Check the [Yuzu documentation](https://yuzu-emu.org/wiki/faq/#how-do-i-use-my-gamecube-controller-adapter) for more information about installing and using GameCube controllers with Yuzu. MayFlash and Nintendo adapters are the easiest to configure.

## Nintendo Pro Controller

Simply plug in your Pro Controller to your PC with a USB-C cable to get started. No configuration is required besides going into Yuzu and clicking `Emulation > Controls > Connect Controller` in the top left.
