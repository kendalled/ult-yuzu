## Direct Links
- The [Yuzu Emulator](https://yuzu-emu.org/downloads/)
- SSBU Game Dump (you need to legally download or <i>find</i> a `.xci` file)
- A prod.keys file (you need a `keys` folder)
- Update files for the most recent patches (once again, Google it)

</alert>

## Next Steps
- Place the ```Smash Ultimate.xci``` file in a folder on your desktop, called `Games` for example.
- Navigate to `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\roaming\yuzu` and paste the folder you downloaded called `keys`. This tells the virtual switch that you own the game you are trying to play.
- Open Yuzu Emulator, set your games directory to where you placed the ```.xci``` file, and enjoy.


## Extra Downloads
If you intend on playing via Parsec (online), and do _not_ have a Nvidia GPU, you need a program to convert your GameCube controller inputs to Xbox 360 inputs. I recommend [delfinovin](https://github.com/Struggleton/Delfinovin/releases/download/v0.02/Delfinovin.zip), but there are many options.

If you try running Delfinovin and it seems to crash, follow [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi2hf6VxmiI).
