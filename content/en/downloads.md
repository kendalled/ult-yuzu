## Direct Links
- The [Yuzu Emulator](https://yuzu-emu.org/downloads/)
- SSBU <expandable-link>game dump</expandable-link> (`.xci` file)
- A <expandable-link>prod.keys</expandable-link> file (download the `keys` folder)

## Next Steps
- Place the ```Smash Ultimate.xci``` file in a folder on your desktop, called `Games` for example.
- Navigate to `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\roaming\yuzu` and paste the folder you downloaded called `keys`. This tells the virtual switch that you own the game you are trying to play.
- Open Yuzu Emulator, set your games directory to where you placed the ```.xci``` file, and enjoy.


## Extra Downloads
If you intend on playing via Parsec (online), and do _not_ have a Nvidia GPU, you need a program to convert your GameCube controller inputs to Xbox 360 inputs. I recommend [x360ce](https://www.x360ce.com/), but there are many options.
