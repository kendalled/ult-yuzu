Check this [PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-update-drivers/) article for more information about installing and updating graphics cards drivers. Below are instructions that should work for any Windows system.

## AMD GPU

Visit AMD's [driver page](https://www.amd.com/en/support), select your graphics card, and update your drivers to the latest version. This may allow you to use the _Vulkan_ engine, which some report has better performance on AMD graphics cards than *OpenGL*.

## Nvidia GPU

Visit Nvidia's [driver page](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx), select your graphics card, and update your drivers to the latest version. Try both _OpenGL_ and _Vulkan_ engines, as performance may vary per system.
